#Hackership Berlin Batch Summer 2015 // Code of Conduct 

*This Code of Conduct is based on that of [Maptime.io](http://maptime.io/code-of-conduct/) on 8 Jul 2015.
The Maptime original version comes from [citizencodeofconduct.org](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Many thanks to them both for the work they do, and for providing language for us to speak to a code of conduct for Hackership.*

A primary goal of Hackership is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Hackership to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

### Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society. If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### Expected Behavior

We expect Hackership participants to participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.

- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
- Alert Hackership leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

Remeber you are working in a shared environment, so:
- Google [privilege](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=privilege) and read up on it.
- Don't talk too loudly. If somebody is bothering you, let him know before freaking out! Use other common spaces if you need to discuss something, make a phone call etc.
- At the end of the day, clean your desk and all the kitchenware that you've used.
- Above all, **be nice to others!**

### Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all Hackership-related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of Hackership. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

Harassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Please pay special attention to the following topics **[to be filled by everyone]**:
- example1  
- example2  
-  ...

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please:

- Flag the behavior! Raise awareness of the behavior. Discuss it directly with the offender using polite words, reminding the offender about the Code of Conduct. Do **NOT** assume that the offense was intentional. We're all humans and mistakes can happen.
- Talk to your family coach.
- Talk to an organizer (Ben/Charlotte/Anouk).
- At the conflict's resolution, share a drink! :beers:

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community participants engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

### Addressing Grievances

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify a Hackership organizer as soon as possible.

### Scope

We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
